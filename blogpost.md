# Browser Feature Releases Comparison

## Global Average Ranks (Across All Features)

The following are the global average rankings for different browsers based on feature adoption and implementation speed. The ranking is based on an aggregate measure of how quickly and consistently each browser implements new features. A lower rank indicates faster adoption and better support for new web technologies.

| Browser | Average Rank |
|---------|--------------|
| Chrome | 2.67 |
| Chrome Android | 4.51 |
| Firefox | 4.64 |
| Internet Explorer | 4.89 |
| Safari | 5.91 |
| Opera | 5.95 |
| Oculus | 6.28 |
| Safari iOS | 6.31 |
| Opera Android | 6.60 |
| WebView Android | 6.72 |
| Firefox Android | 6.99 |
| WebView iOS | 7.23 |
| Samsung Internet Android | 8.17 |
| Edge | 8.48 |
| Deno | 9.93 |
| Node.js | 13.41 |

### **How These Rankings Are Calculated**
The average rank is derived by evaluating multiple feature releases across different browser versions and calculating the relative speed at which each browser implements them. Browsers that adopt features earlier consistently receive a lower rank, while those with significant delays receive a higher rank.

## Browser Adoption Speed Analysis

### **Fast Adopters (Low Delays, Early Adoption):**
- Chrome
- Edge
- Firefox
- Opera (Desktop versions)

### **Moderate Adopters (Some Delays but Not Extreme):**
- Safari
- WebView Android
- Opera Android
- Samsung Internet

### **Slow Adopters (Highest Delays):**
- **Deno (1186.47 days)**
- **Node.js (2463.87 days)**
- **Firefox Android (1455.99 days)**

### **Key Observations:**
- Chrome (588.05 days) and Edge (766.66 days) have relatively low delays, meaning they release features frequently.
- Edge (766.66 days) closely follows Chrome (588.05 days) in release frequency.
- Safari iOS (1086.14 days) and Safari (985.66 days) have similar delays, indicating synchronization in their rollouts.
- Opera (138.42 days) and Opera Android (208.29 days) have a small delay gap, showing alignment.
- Internet Explorer (800.05 days) has long delays, reinforcing its slow adoption rate.
- Deno (1186.47 days) and Node.js (2463.87 days) exhibit extreme delays compared to mainstream browsers.
- Chrome Android (135.49 days) is closely synced with Chrome (588.05 days).
- Firefox Android (1455.99 days) has a much larger delay than Firefox (867.16 days), highlighting a lag in mobile feature adoption.

### **How These Delays Are Measured**
Delays are calculated as the average number of days between when a feature is first introduced in a major browser and when it is adopted by the browser in question. A higher delay value indicates a slower adoption process.

## Most Frequent Release Days per Browser

The table below shows the most common days on which browsers roll out updates. This information helps developers anticipate when major updates are likely to arrive.

| Browser | Release Day | Mobile Equivalent | Release Day |
|---------|------------|------------------|-------------|
| Chrome | Tuesday | Chrome Android | Wednesday |
| Deno | Wednesday | - | - |
| Edge | Wednesday | - | - |
| Firefox | Tuesday | Firefox Android | Tuesday |
| Internet Explorer | Monday | - | - |
| Node.js | Tuesday | - | - |
| Opera | Tuesday | Opera Android | Tuesday |
| Safari | Monday | Safari iOS | Monday |
| Samsung Internet | Saturday | - | - |
| WebView Android | Monday | WebView iOS | Monday |

### **Explanation of Release Days**
Most major browsers follow a scheduled update cycle, with Tuesday and Wednesday being the most common release days. This trend allows developers to plan feature testing and deployments efficiently.

## Conclusion

The data highlights how different browsers adopt new features at varying speeds. Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Opera lead the pack in early adoption, whereas Safari and WebView-based browsers show moderate delays. Deno, Node.js, and Firefox Android exhibit the slowest adoption rates, with significant lags in feature rollouts. Additionally, release days vary across browsers, with Tuesday and Wednesday being the most common days for major desktop browsers.
